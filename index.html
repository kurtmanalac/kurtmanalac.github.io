			<h1>Favorite CMSC subject so far and why</h1>
			<p>
				My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 123, because I learned a lot of basic coding practices, conecpts, and approaches that laid the groundwork for my future in CMSC.  It also helped me adapt to different programming languages' syntax and the like.

			<h1>Favorite GE so far and why</h1>
			<p>
				When I took SPCM 1 during A.Y. 2017-2018 midyear, I never realized it would be the last of its kind, and the most memorable one.  The professor was engaging, technical, and most of all, hilarious.  Despite lasting for 6 weeks, I got close to my classmates and remain close even now.

			<h1>Favorite PL and why</h1>
			<p>
				When I first explored the world of Computer Science, I started out with C++, but now after learning multiple PLs, I learned to love C.  Reason being, it was the closest to C++ as well as being the best PL that laid the foundation of understanding syntax of programming.
